<!-- 2. Go to the `Develop` Hub, click the `+`, and click `Import` to select all notebooks from this repository's [folder](./Code/Notebooks)
3. For each of the notebooks, select `Attach to > spark1` in the top dropdown
4. Configure the parameters in the following notebooks and publish the changes -->
2. In the `Develop` Hub, click the `+`, and click `Import` to select all SQL scripts from this repository's [folder](./Code/SQLScripts)
3. For each SQL script, select `Connect to > sqlpool1` in the top dropdown
4. Select `Run` in the top to create the SQL tables 

## Step 7: Deploy Logic App
In this step you will deploy the reqired resources to process Test forms and/or Vaccination cards sent via email. 

We need to build two different Logic Apps. 
The first logic app we are going to build will help us ingest the Testing forms and process them.
The second logic app we are going to build will help us ingest the Vaccine cards, process them and verify their vailidity.

### Deploy the Logic Apps
The button below will deploy Azure Logic App into the resource group you are using for this solution:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FAzure-Solution-Accelerator-to-automate-COVID-19-Vaccination-Proof-and-Test-Verification-Forms%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fdeploylogicapp.json)

The 2 logic apps will be deployed, one ending in "testform" and the other one ending in "vaccinationcard".

### **Configuring the ARM template**
In order for the logic apps to work, we need to configure the following variables. 

![image14](./images/LA_image14.png "image14")

Populate the variables accordingly:

1. **Resource group**: Use the `same resource group` where the previous ARM template was deployed.

2. **Region**: This field will be auto-filled

3. **Suffix Name**: Insert a `suffix name` (e.g. Your initials)

4. **ADLS Name**: Provide the `same Storage Account` name that was created as part of the Azure Synapse deployment in previous steps

5. **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**: The `forms recognizer access key`.
    * Navigagte to the Forms Recognizer resource in your resource group
    * Select `Keys and Endpoint` on the left and copy `Key 1`

![image6](./images/LA_image6.png "image6")

6. **Computervision Key**: The `PredictionKey` of the custom vision model.
    * Navigate to the Custom Vision Predictions resource in your resource gorup 
    * Select `Keys and Endpoint` on the left and copy `Key 1`

![image12](./images/LA_image12.png "image12")

7. **ComputerVisionPredictions**: The `model name` of the custom vision service.
    * Navigate to the [Azure Custom Vision Portal](https://www.customvision.ai/)
    * Select `Perfomance` click on `Iteration 1` 
    * Copy the `Publisheed as` value 

![image10](./images/LA_image10.png "image10")

8. **Project Id**: The `ProjectID` of the custom vision model.
    * Navigate to the [Azure Custom Vision Portal](https://www.customvision.ai/)
    * Select the Settings (gear icon) in the top right 
    * Copy the Project Id 

![image11](./images/LA_image11.png "image11")

9. **SQLEndpoint**: The `SQL endpoint`
    * Navigate to the Azure Synapse Analytics resource in your resource group
    * Copy the `Dedicated SQL endpoint` value 

![image13](./images/LA_image13.png "image13")

10. **FormsContainerSAS**: The SAS token for the `forms` container
For this step, we need to go to the storage account and inside the container generate a SAS    
* Navigate to the  `forms` container in your storage account in your resource group
* Select the `shared access tokens` on the left
* Under `permissions` select `Read`, `Add` and `List`
* Select a reasonable amount of time before it expires. For the below image, we used a year from today (until 2023)* After we click "Generate SAS token and URL", let's just copy the SAS token.

![image19](./images/LA_image19.png "image19")

11. **VaccineCardsContainerSAS**: The SAS token for the `vaccinecards` container    
* Follow the previous step 

### Configuring the Logic App
Once the Logic Apps are deployed, go to the designer view of either the testform logic app or the vaccination card logic app.

![image15](./images/LA_image15.png "image15")

Configure the following 3 connectors:
a. Email connector
Follow the bellow image to sign in to the outlook account we want to monitor.
> Note: This step assumes you've already created an outlook account that will receive only either the vaccine cards or the testing forms.

![image16](./images/LA_image16.png "image16")

b. Storage connector
Scroll downt until you'll find the "For Each" box. Click the box and then click the "Create blob" box.

![image17](./images/LA_image17.png "image17")
![image17a](./images/LA_image17a.png "image17a")

C. SQL connector
Connect to the sql pool using Azure AD Integrated
![image18](./images/LA_image18.png "image18")

Repeat the same process for the other logic app.
Make sure you use a different email when configuring the email connector. 

### Testing the Logic App
To test the Logic App, you can send an email with a sample form ([Sample Test Form](./Data/SampleTestForms/TestForms/Sampleformtest.pdf) or [Sample Vaccine Card](./Data/SampleTestForms/VaccinationCards/vaccinationcardtest.png)) as attachement to the the email you created in previous step.

> Note: For the subject, it is mandatory to use a random string of numbers. e.g. 12345, 23456, etc. as we set it up as user/employee id.

After sending the email, wait for few seconds, and open Logic Apps interface and then click 'Run Trigger'. The Logic App should start working.

e.g. send an email with vaccine cards to the email you created that receives the vaccine cards.

> Note: The attachment should be less than 3MB in order for the Logic App to work.

## Step 8: Power BI Set Up 
1. Open the [Power BI report](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Solution-Accelerator-to-automate-COVID-19-Vaccination-Proof-and-Test-Verification-Forms/tree/main/Deployment/PowerBI/TestingVaccineDashboard.pbix) in this repository

2. Click the Transform data dropdown and click Data source settings 

![Power BI](./images/PowerBIDataSource.png)

3. Select the Azure Synapse Workspace connection, select `Change Source...` and provide your SQL Server Database name under Server and click `OK`
    * Navigate to the Synapse Workspace overview page in the Azure Portal, copy the Dedicated SQL endpoint
4. Select `Edit Permissions`, under Credentials select `Edit`, sign in to your Microsoft Account, click "OK" and click "Close"
5. Select `Refresh`

<!-- ## Step 9: Function App
The Function is used in the Covid Check Power App to select/insert/update forms documents in the Cosmos DB.
Go to the Azure Portal and note down the name of your Function App.

Follow the steps described in Quickstart: Create a function in Azure with Python using Visual Studio Code Once the local project is created:

Replace the code of the init.py file with the code in the file `Deployment/Function/init.py`
In the code update the url and the key variable. The url should be the URI of your Cosmos DB. The Key is the Primary Key of your Cosmos DB.
Replace the code of the requirements.txt file with the code in the file `Deployment/Function/requirements.txt`
Once all the files are updated, save and Publish the local project to Azure.

After the publication, go to the Function App - Functions, and click on the Function.
Click the button Get Function Url and copy and save the URL. You'll need it in the next step.

## Step 10: Deploy and configure the Covid Check Power App
1. Go to https://make.preview.powerapps.com/
2. In the right upper corner, make sure you select the correct environment where you want to deploy the Power App.
3. Click on `Apps - Import Canvas App`
4. Click upload and select the [Deployment/PowerApp/CCMPowerApp.zip](./Deployment/PowerApp/CovidFormsPowerApp) Zipfile.
5. Review the package content. You should see the details as the screenshot below

  ![Review Package Content](./images/PowerApp_ReviewPackageContent.jpg "Review Package Content")

6. Under the `Review Package Content`, click on the little wrench next to the Application Name `Covid Check`, to change the name of the Application. Make sure the name is unique for the environemnt.
7. Click Import and wait until you see the message `All package resources were successfully imported.`
8. Click on `Flows`. You will notice that all the flows are disabled. 

![Cloud Flows disabled](./images/PowerApp_CloudFlows.jpg "CloudFlows")

9. You need to turn them on before you can use them. Hover over each of the flows, select the button `More Commands` and click `Turn on`.

![Turn on Cloud Flows](./images/PowerApp_TurnonCloudFlows.png "TurnonCloudFlows")

10. For each flow, you need to change the HTTP component so that the URI points to your Azure Function App. Edit each flow, open the HTTP component and past the Azure Function Url before the first &.
Your URI should look similar like the screenshot below.

![HTTP](./images/PowerApp_HTTP.jpg "HTTP")

12. After the modification, click the "Test" button in the upper right corner to test the flow. If all went well, you should receive "Your flow ran successfully".
13. Once the flows are modified, you should be able to open the Power App. -->
